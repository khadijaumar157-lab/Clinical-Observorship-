**Case 4: NICU Observation – Congenital Cataracts and Early Intervention**

**Case Profile**

This NICU case involved a newborn diagnosed with congenital cataracts during routine neonatal screening. The opacity of the lens posed a significant risk to visual development, despite the infant being otherwise clinically stable.

The care team emphasized early ophthalmologic evaluation, recognizing that delayed intervention could result in irreversible visual impairment due to disrupted neural development.

**What I Learned & Gained**

This case highlighted the time-sensitive nature of developmental biology. I learned how sensory input during early life is critical for proper neural pathway formation, and how structural disruptions like lens opacity—can alter long-term neurological outcomes.

I also gained exposure to how congenital conditions can arise from genetic, metabolic, or environmental factors, underscoring the intersection of genetics and developmental cell biology.

**Personal Reflection**

This case deeply impacted me because it showed how something invisible to an untrained eye could change an entire life trajectory. It reinforced the power of early diagnosis and preventive medicine. The NICU environment also highlighted how fragile yet resilient newborns are.
