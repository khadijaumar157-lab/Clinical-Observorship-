**Case 1: Lumbar Puncture in Suspected Meningitis (Neurology)**

**Case Profile**

This case involved an infant who was irritable but largely asymptomatic, admitted for evaluation due to concern for central nervous system infection. Although there were no overt neurological deficits or seizures, subtle indicators- persistent irritability, altered cry, and parental concern—prompted further investigation. After detailed counseling, informed consent was obtained from the parents for a lumbar puncture. The procedure was conducted under strict aseptic conditions, with the infant appropriately positioned to minimize discomfort and risk.
The lumbar puncture was performed to assess cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) parameters, including cell count, glucose, protein, and culture, to rule out or confirm meningitis. Continuous monitoring before, during, and after the procedure emphasized patient safety.

**What I Learned & Gained**

I learned that meningitis in infants can present very subtly and that the absence of dramatic symptoms does not rule out serious pathology. Clinical suspicion plays a huge role in pediatrics. I observed how clinicians balance urgency with caution, especially when dealing with invasive procedures in infants. I also learned the importance of parental consent—not as a formality, but as a process involving explanation, reassurance, and trust-building.
From a technical perspective, I gained insight into indications for lumbar puncture, contraindications, and post-procedure monitoring (such as watching for apnea, changes in vitals, or irritability).

**Personal Reflection**

This case taught me that pediatrics is a discipline of intuition sharpened by science. The baby could not communicate symptoms, so the clinicians had to “read” behavior and subtle signs. It reinforced how ethical practice and communication with parents are just as critical as clinical knowledge. Watching the team act decisively yet gently left a strong impression on me.
