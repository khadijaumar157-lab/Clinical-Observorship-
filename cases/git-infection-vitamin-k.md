**Case 5: Gastrointestinal Infection and Vitamin K Administration**

**Case Profile**

This infant presented with gastrointestinal symptoms, including altered stool patterns suggestive of infection or malabsorption. Stool examination played a central role in assessing hydration status, digestive function, and potential microbial involvement.

Vitamin K administration, part of routine neonatal care, was noted for its role in preventing hemorrhagic disease, especially in infants with immature gut microbiota and limited endogenous synthesis.

**What I Learned & Gained**

I learned how gut microbiota, nutrition, and coagulation biology intersect in early life. Stool characteristics served as a non-invasive diagnostic indicator, reflecting underlying physiological and microbial processes.

This case emphasized the importance of preventive interventions and how seemingly simple measures like vitamin supplementation are grounded in biological necessity.

**Personal Reflection**

This case reminded me that biology often reveals itself through careful observation. It reinforced my interest in microbiology and nutritional biology, particularly how early-life interventions can prevent severe downstream consequences.
