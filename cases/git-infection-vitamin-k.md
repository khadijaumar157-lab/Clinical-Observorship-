Case 5: Gastrointestinal Infection and Vitamin K Administration
Case Profile
This infant presented with symptoms of gastrointestinal infection, including altered stool patterns. As part of routine neonatal and pediatric care, vitamin K injections had been administered earlier to prevent hemorrhagic disease of the newborn. Stool inspection was an important component of assessment, as variations in color and consistency provided clues to hydration status, infection, and possible malabsorption.
The medical team closely monitored intake, output, and signs of dehydration.
What I Learned & Gained
I learned how stool characteristics can be a diagnostic tool in pediatrics, offering insight into gastrointestinal health. I also understood the preventive role of vitamin K and how early interventions can avert life threatening complications. This case strengthened my understanding of basic yet critical clinical observations.
Personal Reflection
This case taught me that medicine often begins with observation. Before advanced tests, clinicians rely on careful inspection and pattern recognition. It reminded me that small details—often overlooked—can guide big decisions in patient care.
