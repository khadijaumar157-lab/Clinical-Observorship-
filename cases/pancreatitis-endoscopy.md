Case 2: Acute Pancreatitis and Endoscopic Evaluation (Gastroenterology)
Case Profile	
This pediatric case involved suspected acute pancreatitis, identified through clinical presentation and laboratory findings. The patient was under close observation due to abdominal discomfort and feeding intolerance. Imaging and biochemical markers supported the diagnosis, and further evaluation through endoscopic assessment was planned to understand underlying causes and complications.
Parental consent was obtained prior to the endoscopic procedure, and the child was carefully prepared, with anesthesia considerations discussed in detail. The multidisciplinary involvement of pediatrics, gastroenterology, and anesthesia was evident throughout the process.
What I Learned & Gained
I learned that pancreatitis in children differs significantly from adult presentations, both in etiology and management. I observed how endoscopy is not just a diagnostic tool but can guide management decisions. The coordination between specialties highlighted how pediatric care is deeply collaborative.
I also learned about the importance of nutrition management, monitoring enzyme levels, and preventing complications such as dehydration or electrolyte imbalance.
Personal Reflection
This case expanded my understanding of how complex gastrointestinal conditions can be even in very young patients. It showed me how cautious and calculated pediatric interventions are, and how every step is taken with long term outcomes in mind. It made me appreciate how technology and teamwork intersect in modern medicine.
