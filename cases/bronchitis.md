Case 3: Bronchitis – Common Respiratory Conditions in Clinical Practice
Case Profile
This case involved an infant admitted with symptoms of lower respiratory tract infection, including cough, increased work of breathing, and mild oxygen requirement. The diagnosis of bronchitis was made clinically, supported by physical examination findings such as wheezing and crackles.
Management focused on supportive care, including oxygen therapy, hydration, and monitoring. No invasive procedures were required, but close observation was maintained due to the patient’s age and vulnerability.
What I Learned & Gained
I learned that bronchitis, although common, can become serious in infants due to smaller airways and immature immune systems. I observed how clinicians differentiate between viral and bacterial causes and avoid unnecessary antibiotics. Monitoring respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and feeding tolerance was emphasized.
I gained insight into how early intervention and observation can prevent escalation to more severe respiratory distress.
Personal Reflection
This case reminded me that common conditions still deserve respect. In pediatrics, “routine” does not mean “minor.” Watching how carefully the team monitored a seemingly straightforward illness reinforced the importance of vigilance and prevention.
