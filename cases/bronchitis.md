**Case 3: Bronchitis – Common Respiratory Conditions in Clinical Practice** 

**Case Profile**

This case involved an infant admitted with signs of lower respiratory tract infection, including cough, increased work of breathing, and mild oxygen dependency. The diagnosis of bronchitis was made clinically, with careful monitoring due to the infant’s narrow airways and developing immune system.

Management focused on supportive care, emphasizing oxygenation, hydration, and continuous observation rather than aggressive pharmacological intervention.

**What I Learned & Gained**

I learned how airway anatomy and lung development influence disease severity in infants. Minor inflammation that would be well tolerated in adults can significantly impair airflow in younger patients due to smaller bronchi and immature respiratory control mechanisms.

This case also illustrated how immune responses in early life are still developing, affecting both susceptibility to infection and recovery patterns.

**Personal Reflection**

This case reminded me that common conditions still deserve respect. In pediatrics, “routine” does not mean “minor.” Watching how carefully the team monitored a seemingly straightforward illness reinforced the importance of vigilance and prevention.
